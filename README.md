# UFO sightings

<p>This project will create a webpage with a dynamic table to filter the information about sightings of UFOs. The webpage has an ability to search by date, country, state, city and also the shape of the alians. This will will allow users to search through the table for specific information.</p>
<p>This project involves use of <b> JavaScript, HTML, and CSS </b></p>
<p> HTML File - index.html</p>
<p>As a recommendation for future development,</p>
<p> 1.  We can build graphs that show the trend based on the filter criteria. This will help in building visual analysis.</p>
<p> 2.  We can build predictive analysis based on the actual data which can help the scientist get a lead to the next sighting.</p>
